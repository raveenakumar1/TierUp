# Repository Details

This repository includes two files (main.py and animal_images.py) for the Discord bot TierUP

# Description

TierUP is a Discord bot that is designed to monitor and increase user engagement within a Discord server

# How it Works

As users actively contribute to the server by sending messages, TierUP keeps a count. When a user achieves the milestone of 10 messages, the bot delivers a  congratulatory message, marking the user's rise to a new level.
